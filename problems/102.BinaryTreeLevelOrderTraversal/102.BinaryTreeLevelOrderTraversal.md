# Question Description:

#### 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
![TreeExample](TreeExample.png)
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

# Idea:

Define a queue, by using its character of FIFO, we push a node, pop it, and then push its left node and right node until queue becomes empty. In order to store it in a two dimension vector, the size of queue is calculated, by traversing the queue according its size, we store it into a  one dimension vector,then put the one dimension vector into two dimension vector.  

# Solution:

`/**`

 `\* Definition for a binary tree node.`

 `\* struct TreeNode {`

 `\*   int val;`

 `\*   TreeNode *left;`

 `\*   TreeNode *right;`

 `\*   TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}`

 `\* };`
