# Question Description:

#### 200. Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

Input:  
11110  
11010  
11000  
00000  

Output: 1  
**Example 2:**

Input:  
11000  
11000  
00100  
00011  

Output: 3  

# Idea:

**Breadth First Search(BFS)**  

Because islands is formed by connecting adjacent lands ('1')horizontally or vertically,  firstly we traverse the grid and get '1'. We give it a new value '0' and at the same time push its index into a queue. Besides by using BFS we visit all its surrounding elements, when meeting '1', push it into queue. For all its surrounding elements we repeat the last steps. In this way after a BFS, we get  '1' which are all adjacent and they formed an island. Therefore,  the times of BFS is the number of islands.
