# Question Description:

#### 820. Short Encoding of Words

Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string S and a list of indexes A.

For example, if the list of words is ["time", "me", "bell"], we can write it as S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string S possible that encodes the given words?

Example:

Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Note:

    1 <= words.length <= 2000.
    1 <= words[i].length <= 7.
    Each word has only lowercase letters.

# Idea:

1. Put the list words into set, because the elements in set are unique, so firstly we delete the repeating elements; 
2. Erase the elements which are suffix of other elements, then we count the left elements and add up all the length of string and the number of '#'.

# Solution:

`class Solution {`

`public:`

  `int minimumLengthEncoding(vector<string>& words) {`

​    `set<string> s(words.begin(), words.end());`

​    `for (auto word: words){`

​      `for(int i = 1; i< word.length(); i++)`

​      `{`

​        `s.erase(word.substr(i));`  

​      `}`     

​    `}`

​    `int res = 0;`

​    `for(auto str : s)`

​    `{`

​      `res+=str.length() + 1;`

​    `}`

​    `return res;`

  `}`

`};`
