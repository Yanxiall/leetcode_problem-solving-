# Question Description:

#### 1162. As Far from Land as Possible

Given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

**Example 1:**

Input: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.

**Example 2:**

Input: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.


Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
grid`[i][j]` is 0 or 1

# Idea:

Algorithm: Dynamic Programming

To get the water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, we can get the distance of each water cell to  the nearest land cell and find the maximum of them. 

1.  The distance of each water cell to  the nearest land cell is related to the cell next to it. like:
   $$
   dp[i][j]= \left\{\begin{matrix}
   0, \quad if\left ( i,j \right ) \quad is \quad land & \\ 
    min\left ( dp\left ( i-1,j\right ),dp\left ( i,j-1 \right ) \right )+1,\quad if\left ( i,j \right ) \quad is \quad water& 
   \end{matrix}\right.
   $$
   ​	
   $$
   dp[i][j]= \left\{\begin{matrix}
   0, \quad if\left ( i,j \right ) \quad is \quad land & \\ 
    min\left ( dp\left ( i+1,j\right ),dp\left ( i,j+1 \right ) \right )+1,\quad if\left ( i,j \right ) \quad is \quad water& 
   \end{matrix}\right.
   $$
   so we traverse the grid twice, once from top left to bottom right, once from bottom right to top left;

2. find the maximum in dp, notice the boarder value and special cases, like all lands and all water.
