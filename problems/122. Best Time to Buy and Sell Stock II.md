# Question Description:

#### 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).  

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

**Example 1:**  

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 7  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.  
**Example 2:**  

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are  
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.  
**Example 3:**  

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.  


Constraints:  

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4  
0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4  

# Idea:

**Method 1:**

If we plot the prices on the chart, we can get a chart with valley and peak. To get the max profit we can buy the stock at vally and sell the stock at peak.  

**Method 2:** 

greedy algorithm: we traverse all prices and let prices[i] - prices[i-1],  when  prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0, we add it up to the profit, otherwise we go on traversing. 

# Solution:

**C++:**

**Method 1:**

`class Solution {`

`public:`

  `int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {`

​    `if(prices.size()==0)`

​     `return 0;`

​    `int i=0;`

​    `int vally=prices[0];`

​    `int peak=prices[0];`

​    `int maxPro=0;`    

​    `while(i<prices.size()-1)`

​    `{`

​      `while(i<prices.size()-1 && prices[i]>=prices[i+1] )`

​       `i++;`

​      `vally=prices[i];`

​      `while(i<prices.size()-1 && prices[i]<=prices[i+1])`

​       `i++;`

​      `peak=prices[i];`

​      `maxPro += peak-vally;`

​    `}`

​    `return maxPro;`

  `}`

`};`

**Method 2:**

`class Solution {`

`public:`

  `int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {`

​    `int profit = 0;`

​    `for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++)`

​    `{  int temp = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];`

​      `if(temp > 0)`

​      `{`

​        `profit += temp;`

​      `}`

​    `}`

​    `return profit;`

  `}`

`};`
